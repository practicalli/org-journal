* Add Org Journal to Spacemacs
~SPC a o j j~ creates a new journal entry in an org file, with all the org features available.

The first time a new journal entry is created, Spacemacs prompts to create the file and directory (if not yet created).

Added org-journal as an org layer variable with suggested settings from https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/org/README.html#org-journal-support
