** DONE Ride to Welwyn Garden City
   CLOSED: [2020-05-03 Sun 19:11]
   A cool ride of 125km to Welwyn Garden City and back again.  The wind was relatively low and once past Barnet more countryside was on show.  Once hitting Herofordshire then it was all countryside.
   The route was lumpy and had quite a lot of ascents and drops.  The toughest ascent was on the way out of London, cycling up Highgate West Hill (East side of Hampstead heath).  That road was approximately 5km of steep climb, coming after a further 5km of moderate climb, so was a good work out.
   Ozzi's Burrito Shack in Barnet looked a tempting place to get food and was open (possibly only for collection).  Unfortunately there was not much appetite for food on the way back through Barnet, but will keep it in mind for next time the cycle route takes us that direction.
   An SIS Rego Vanilla shake was enjoyed at the end of the ride, with a level tablespoon of ginger powder and a sprinkling of turmeric powder to help recovery.  This was followed by a butter bean, garden pea and peanut meddle with soy sauce.
