** DONE Customise Klipse CSS - remove large bottom border
   CLOSED: [2020-05-06 Wed 15:52]
   The Klipse plugin for GitBook shows a large gray border at the bottom of each Klipse box, taking up a lot of unnecessary space.
    Two div classes were adding extra space to the bottom border, =klipse-container= and =klipse-separator=
    Updated the GitBook styles/website.css with `display: none;` style to hide the specific div's from the page

#+BEGIN_SRC css
div.klipse-container {
    display: none;
}

div.klipse-separator {
    display: none;
}
#+END_SRC
